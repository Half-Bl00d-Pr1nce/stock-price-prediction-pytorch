# 📈 Stock Price Prediction Using PyTorch

This project represents a practical, industry-oriented end-to-end deep learning workflow for time-series forecasting, designed to reflect real-world machine learning practices. It covers all critical stages of a predictive modeling pipeline, from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and visualization.

This project is perfect for:
- 📊 Data Science and Machine Learning aspirants who want to build a strong Portfolio Project
- 📚 Anyone learning PyTorch and time-series forecasting
- 💼 Professionals preparing for Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, or Quantitative Analyst roles

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict stock prices using historical market data, demonstrating the ability to apply deep learning techniques to time-series data by:

- ✅ Data Preparation & Preprocessing (Python): Clean, normalize, and prepare historical stock market data for modeling
- ✅ Time-Series Modeling (PyTorch): Design and train a deep learning model suitable for sequential data (LSTM / RNN / MLP)
- ✅ Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using regression metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and MSE
- ✅ Visualization & Insights: Visualize predicted vs actual stock prices to assess forecasting accuracy and model behavior
